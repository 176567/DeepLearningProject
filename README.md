Face attribute classification
We are developing a deep learning model employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately categorize facial features such as age, gender, facial hair, eyeglasses, and headwear. This is a multi-label problem, so one image can have multiple labels. We are to begin with a selection of fundamental attributes and gradually expand the model's ability with additional characteristics.
This neural network can be used, to make observation about people based on their appearance.
