Music genre classification based on audio
We are developing a deep learning model designed for the classification of music genres. 
The aim of this task is to precisely determine the genre of a given music piece. 
This application can enhance music recommendation systems, music search engines, and various other music-related platforms that heavily depend on precise genre identification. 
Figuring out music types can also help us understand different music styles better.
